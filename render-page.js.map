Но отличается от указанного упражнения тем, что жим гантелей лежа выполняется с большей амплитудой, что способствует большему растягиванию и сокращению грудных мышц, задействует большее число мышц-стабилизаторов.</p>\\n<p>Если вы хотите правильно развивать грудные мышцы и увеличивать силовые показатели, то вы должны регулярно выполнять жимы гантелями.</p>\\n<h3>Порядок выполнения:</h3>\\n<ol>\\n  <li>Возьмите гантели в каждую руку, сядьте с ними на горизонтальную силовую скамью. Положите гантели на бедра и после этого лягте на скамью.</li>\\n  <li>Исходное положение: спина прогнута в пояснице, стопы ног упираются в пол. Руки с гантелями находятся на уровне плечей, грифы гантелей расположены на одной линии.</li>\\n  <li>На выдохе – вернитесь в исходное положение, максимально растягивая грудь.</li>\\n  <li>Проделайте необходимое количество повторений.</li>\\n  <li>Повторите упражнение нужное число раз.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>Советы:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n  <li>Во время выполнения упражнения следите за траекторией – гантели должны двигаться только в одной плоскости.</li>\\n  <li>Если в верхней точке разворачивать руки ладонями друг к другу и сильнее сводить гантели, то ваши грудные мышцы сократятся сильнее.</li>\\n  <li>Нижняя точка жима гантелей - когда гантели коснутся плеч. Не ниже.</li>\\n  <li>Полностью выпрямляя локти, вы включаете в работу трицепсы рук.

Наиболее распространенные это «грудной» и «лифтерский» жимы. Основное различие заключается в том, что в «лифтерском» варианте в работе задействовано больше мышц, но нагрузка на грудные мышцы немного уменьшается, кроме этого более безопасно для суставов и связок.</p>\\n<h3>Порядок выполнения:</h3>\\n<ol>\\n  <li>Исходное положение: лягте спиной на горизонтальную скамью. Спина прогнута в пояснице, лопатки соединены, ноги под прямым углом в упоре. Возьмите штангу таким хватом, чтобы в нижней точке межу плечом и предплечьем был прямой угол. Держите её прямо над собой, на уровне плечей. «Лифтерский» вариант отличается тем, что необходимо практически встать на мост – ступни находятся в упоре примерно на уровне таза, который прижат к скамье.</li>\\n  <li>На вдохе - опускайте штангу вниз, пока не коснетесь середины груди.

Постоянная высокая нагрузка может привести к болям в кистях.</li>\\n  <li>Никогда не делайте жим, если Вы один в зале. Это может привести к печальным последствиям.

Подъем ног в упоре (или в висе) как раз относится к наиболее эффективным и популярным, и по своей сути является «скручиванием наоборот»: низ тела скручивается к верхней части туловища. Для выполнения подъема ног нужен тренажер с опорами для локтей.</p>\\n<h3>Порядок выполнения:</h3>\\n<ol>\\n  <li>Исходное положение - займите позицию в тренажере, возьмитесь за рукоятки. Руки согнуты под прямым углом. Плечи расправлены, поясница прижата к тренажеру, туловище выпрямлено.</li>\\n  <li>На выдохе - поднимайте колени вверх, в направлении к груди.

Подъем ног выполняйте плавно и размеренно, напрягая мышцы пресса.</li>\\n  <li>Положение ног не важно при выполнении упражнения. Т.к. мышцы пресса тянут не ноги, а таз. Думайте во время выполнения о том, как можно выше поднять таз, а не ноги.</li>\\n  <li>Старайтесь таз не только поднимать, но и подавать (подкручивать) его вперед.</li>\\n  <li>Не раскачивайтесь и не делайте рывков. Подъем ног выполняйте плавно и размеренно, напрягая мышцы пресса.</li>\\n  <li>Подъем ног можно выполнять не только прямо вверх, но и в стороны, что походит по технике на диагональные скручивания и прокачивает косые мышцы живота.</li>\\n  <li>Не сползайте вниз при выполнении упражнения!
